        <h2 style="color:#FFFFFF; text-align: center;">Welcome to Interact with STEM</h2>
        <p style="color:#FFFFFF; text-align: center;"> A website where you can find STEM events, classes, clubs, camps, and more. It is designed for both parents and children to be able to find opportunities to grow and find their passion. Each event, activity, etc. has links to social media and the website. There is also the location of the event and age to participate if applicable. We believe that having the opportunity to introduce youth to STEM is the key to closing the gap and leveling out the playing field. </p>
