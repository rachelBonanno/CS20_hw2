Through Girls With Impact, I was able        to take my idea and break it down into what I needed to do and how I could        do it. I never thought at 17 that I would be starting my own business. And        I definitely never anticipated bringing it to life during a pandemic. As        my website grew so did my ideas. I wanted it to be easy to use with a lot        of opportunities for ways to interact with STEM. The problem was I only        live in one place. Therefore, the opportunities I know about are only in my        area and a few other states. I know that not everyone who is interested in        STEM lives in the Northeast and I did not want to limit opportunities to that        area. This is where the idea of being able to contact I-STEM with        opportunities in one’s region, town, city, or village came into play. I        ]realized I can't be everywhere at one time but if we band together and share        opportunities the task of having events across the country does not seem as        hard anymore. As said by the Salvation Army, sharing is caring. This website        is a resource I wish I had when I started getting interested in STEM. I can        only imagine what I would be doing now if I had all of these opportunities at my        fingertips from the start. I am thrilled that I was able to bring my idea to        life and share my passion for STEM with the world.<span style="color:        #FFC303; font-size: 50px;">”</span> </p>      <p style="color: #FFC303;">- Said by the Founder - </p>    </div>    <div style="padding-left:3%; padding-right:3%;">      <h2 style="text-align: left;">Our <span style="color: #FFC303;">Goal      </span></h2>      <p style="text-align: left;">        To inspire the underrepresented groups in STEM, through sharing events,        that one may have not found out about otherwise, in order to close the        gap and equal the field.      </p>    </div>    <div>      <h2>Our Team</h2>      <h3> Rachel Bonanno</h3>      <img src="../images/me.jpg" style="height:150px;">      <p style="color: #FFC303";>Founder</p>      <p style="padding-left:3%; padding-right:3%;">I have always been a STEM kid. I love math and science and I always        knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life doing something in one of those fields. I really wanted to go to space, I still do. My dream was to be the first child in space and the first person on Mars. It wasn't until 6th grade though that I learned the true meaning of STEM. Who knew I could do more than the 5 core classes. When I was introduced to robotics and coding I just fell in love. I wanted more. I did not want to stop learning. When I started to develop and show the skills I had in the technology my mother started to research ways for me to grow and learn more. Over time it became clear that finding STEM events was not the easiest thing. You have to know exactly what you are looking for and even if you do, you are probably still missing out on amazing opportunities all around you. So why not make a place for people to find events, clubs, activities, organizations, and other resources?</p>    </div></div></body></html>
